            <p>Paarthurnax, called "the Old One" by other dov, is the leader of the Greybeards. He served as Alduin's lieutenant
                during the Dragon War in the Merethic Era, during which he was said to have committed and witnessed unspeakable
                atrocities against mankind.</p>

            <p>
                <strong> Merethic EraEdit</strong>
                <br> Paarthurnax claims it was Alduin's false claim of godhood that turned him against his older brother. However,
                Nordic legend states that it was Kyne herself who intervened, and sent Paarthurnax to assist mankind. Either
                way, Paarthurnax, along with several other Dragons, betrayed their former master and taught mankind to use
                the Thu'um. Mankind eventually prevailed and Alduin was banished from Mundus. As with all Dragons, the lust
                for power was innate and still strong within him and if left unchecked, he would surely revert to his old
                ways. To overcome this, he retired to the peak of the Throat of the World and lived in seclusion so that
                he could meditate and focus on the Way of the Voice, a pacifist creed developed by Jurgen Windcaller that
                preached the Thu'um should only be used for the worship and glory of the gods rather than martial exploits.
                Jurgen Windcaller also founded the Greybeards, a monastic order dedicated to mastering the Way of the Voice.
                He built High Hrothgar, located near the peak of the Throat of the World, which served as the monastery where
                the Greybeards meditated and perfected their Voice. Paarthurnax became the grandmaster of the Greybeards,
                but continued to live in seclusion at the peak of the mountain.</p>

                <strong>First Era</strong>
                <br> Some time after 1E 420, he would often visit the legendary Dragon Numinex during his imprisonment in Dragonsreach.
                He recalls that Numinex was so lonely and disturbed by his captivity that he could not remember his own name.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>Fourth Era</strong>
                <br> The Blades kept a record of any known surviving Dragons from the Dragon War. According to the Atlas of Dragons,
                Paarthurnax is recorded as one of the only dragons that survived. Given his history, and the atrocities he
                committed during the Dragon War, the Blades are very keen to see him brought to justice.</p>
